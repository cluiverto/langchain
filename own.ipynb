She would always be the thirty-seventh oldest\\nperson, and after her rabies experiment Prime Intellect had shut\\nthe door on further explorations of that nature. But the Death\\nJockeys constantly rated and ranked themselves by inventiveness\\nand daring and many other factors. It was an ongoing competition,\\nand if Caroline didn\\'t keep working at it she\\'d be lost in an always-\\ngrowing crowd of contenders.

She knew it did not like Death Jockeys one\\nlittle bit, if a computer could even be said to \"like\" or \"dislike\"\\nanything. And in Caroline\\'s case the feeling was certainly mutual.\\n In her fantasies, she dreamed of having the power to give it a\\ncase of heartburn so big its gears would stop turning.\\nMost people did not share Caroline\\'s distaste for the\\nOmniscient One. A great many worshipped it, despite its apparent\\nembarrassment over the fact. But why not? It could and would do\\ndamn near anything you asked, as long as it didn\\'t affect anyone\\nelse. And even that was open to negotiation with the other people\\nyou might want to involve. There were no noticeable limits to its\\npower and it never asked why. Caroline knew a whole crowd of\\npeople who preferred for Prime Intellect to manifest itself in the\\nform of an attractive member of the opposite sex. Prime Intellect\\nwas nothing less than the perfect God, made incarnate by the\\npower of technology. Caroline couldn\\'t see how fucking God was\\nless perverted than being death-obsessed, but hey, there it was.\\nCaroline hadn\\'t been all that impressed with God even in the\\ndays before Lawrence had brought it forth in his own image. She\\npreferred to keep it in its place. It was just a computer.

If they were manufacturing MPPP,\\na powerful synthetic heroin substitue, and they cooled the\\npreparation too rapidly at a critical step, a slightly different\\ncompound called MPTP was formed along with the dope. This\\ncompound delivered a horribly sinister side effect: It homed in on\\na particular group of cells, the unique brown neurons of the\\nsubstantia nigra, and killed them. Nobody knew exactly how or\\nwhy this happened in 1985, though Prime Intellect said it was\\nbecause the drug was converted into an enzyme which triggered\\nthe cells to release too much dopamine at once, leaving them with\\nan insufficient supply to power their unique metabolism. In any\\ncase the damage could not be repaired, although a useful\\ntreatment was discovered a few years before the Change.\\nWhen a decision is made by the neurons of the cerebral cortex\\nto move a group of muscles, it is the substantia nigra which relays\\nthis command to more primitive parts of the brain.

She had spent\\nhalf the hypodermic on herself, and found the effect to be\\nappropriately terrifying and complete.

Before the Change,\\nperhaps?\\nIn any case, she had to find out soon or never, because\\nCaroline was dying. She had never quite been the same after\\nLawrence\\'s death, but she had still been active, even energetic.\\nShe just hadn\\'t taken such a direct role in the community\\'s\\nactivities. She had gradually loosened her grip, to the point that\\nnow there were many youngsters who had never even met her.\\nThen she had gotten slower and quieter, and lately it had become\\nquite hard for her to walk up a difficult slope. Nugget wasn\\'t so\\nyoung herself; she had already survived Ozark, who had died in his\\nsleep, and her youngest brother Pilgrim was fading fast. He had\\nsome kind of condition which made his movements painful, and\\nfor which Mother Caroline\\'s wisdom had offered no help.\\nAnd now for two days she hadn\\'t eaten.\\n\"I have ripe blackberries,\" Nugget said as she approached\\nCaroline\\'s shelter. \"They will do you good.\"\\nCaroline looked at Nugget, and could see that Nugget\\nsuspected. \"You know I have no need of those,\" she said softly.\\n\"My time is coming.\"\\nNugget was surprised how tiny and despairing her voice\\nsounded when she said, \"Why?\"\\nCaroline laughed, and coughed a little. \"I have to,\" she said.\\n\"It would be wrong to try and fight it.\"\\n\"Mother, I need to talk to you before you go.\"\\nCaroline smiled. \"About what, child, your birch tablets?\"\\nNugget froze, her eyes wide.\\n\"I\\'ve known about those for more than fifty years.

I lived a hundred and six years in the World\\nBefore, and I was dying then as I am dying now. I didn\\'t know it,\\nbut your father was working as I was dying. He was a great man.\\nThere has never been another like him, but he was not perfect and\\nhe made one terrible mistake.\\n\"With the help of many thousands of other people, your father\\nbuilt a vast and complicated thing. The word for it is on your\\ntablets; it was called a computer. That\\'s nothing but a meaningless\\nword to you, and that\\'s all it needs to be. But of all the artisans\\nwho dedicated themselves to the making of the computer, your\\nfather was the most important, because he was the one that\\ntaught it to think. Without the others to help him Lawrence could\\nnot have made the computer, but without Lawrence, the others\\ncould not have made it live; you have to remember that.\"\\n\"Okay, Mother.\"\\n\"The computer could not disobey Lawrence, but he was afraid\\nother people would use it for bad purposes. So he taught it to\\nanswer first to its own conscience, the conscience he had created\\nfor it.

So it made us\\nimmortal.\"\\n\"Just like that?\"\\n\"That was the least of its powers. It remade the world. There\\nwas nothing we couldn\\'t have for the asking. There was nothing\\nwe couldn\\'t do. Nothing could ever hurt us.\" She coughed again.\\n\"It was fucking boring.\"\\nTheir eyes met.\\n\"It was the worst thing ever. Nothing mattered. Not pain, not\\naccomplishments, not anything.\" Caroline touched one of Nugget\\'s\\ntattoos, the small spiral which Ozark had tattooed above her right\\nbreast to celebrate their first coupling after his Vision Quest,\\nwhen they were finally both adults. \"After the Change, the World\\nBefore became another of the words you overheard. Cyberspace.\\nIn Cyberspace, all you\\'d have to do is make a wish and your tattoos\\nwould be gone.\"\\nInvoluntarily, Nugget put her hand over Caroline\\'s, as if to\\ndefend the design.\\n\"Or you could move \\'em around. Get new ones -- it didn\\'t take\\nany time, didn\\'t have to hurt. See? Nothing mattered. I\\'ve worn\\nmany different sets of tattoos myself. But these are the ones that\\nmatter to me, because these are the ones I\\'ll die with. That was the\\nleast of it, of course. You could grow a few extra arms, turn\\nyourself into a bat, fly like a bird, whatever you wanted. But why\\nbother?\"\\n\"Mother...What happened then?\"\\n\"For almost six hundred years, nothing happened worth\\nmentioning. Then, finally, your father and I killed it.\"\\n\"How? If it was so powerful, how could you kill it?\"\\n\"Your father built it, remember. He\\'d never designed it to run\\nthe whole world, only to be a good helper. He knew its\\nweaknesses. So we were able to trick it, and it broke.\" She swept\\nher hand. \"Somehow we ended up here.\"\\nNugget dipped her hand in the hot water and splashed her\\nface. None of this was what she had expected.\\n\"If you will do something else for me, I\\'ll tell you one more\\nthing.\"\\n\"What, Mother?\"\\n\"Promise me that you will give the birch barks to the Eldest\\nFather to be burned with me. Those words belong to the World\\nBefore. They may be harmless, but I\\'d rather not have your\\nfather\\'s only memory be those reminders of his worst failure.\"\\n\"What will you tell me for promising this?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the computer\\'s name.\"\\nThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n132 of 134 23/03/08 23:03'),\n",
